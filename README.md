# HousePrices-Corr-Feature-selection

Using the House Prices dataset from kaggle, 
I did a little bit of data exploration with it and tried to narrow down the number of important variables in order to predict house prices
I also included some data cleaning and outliers handling in this project.

This project only takes into account numerical variables and variables with a linear correlation
To further improve:
1. Check for other non-linear correlation
2. feature selection of categorical variables
